# OpenAPI generated server

Spring Boot Server

## Overview  
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.
This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)

Start your server as a simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8701/

Change default port value in application.properties

## start server
```bash
# run all the dependencies
# check the dex root README.md

# runs the order service
cd $HOME/pet-project/dex/services/order
./gradlew run
```

## development
```bash
# generate stubs from api spec
./gradlew openApiGenerate
```
